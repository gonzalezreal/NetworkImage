/// A view that displays an image located at a given URL.
///
/// A network image downloads and displays an image from a given URL; the download is asynchronous,
/// and the result is cached both in disk and memory.
///
/// You create a network image, in its simplest form, by providing the image URL.
///
///     NetworkImage(url: URL(string: "https://picsum.photos/id/237/300/200"))
///
/// You can also provide the name of a placeholder image that the view will display while the image is loading or, as
/// a fallback, if an error occurs or the URL is `nil`.
///
///     NetworkImage(url: URL(string: "https://picsum.photos/id/237/300/200"),
///                  placeholderSystemImage: "photo.fill")
///
/// If you want, you can only provide a fallback image. A network image view only displays this image if an error occurs
/// or when the URL is `nil`.
///
///     NetworkImage(url: URL(string: "https://picsum.photos/id/237/300/200"),
///                  fallbackSystemImage: "photo.fill")
///
/// It is also possible to create network images using views to compose the network image's placeholders
/// programmatically.
///
///     NetworkImage(url: movie.posterURL) {
///         ProgressView()
///     } fallback: {
///         Text(movie.title)
///             .padding()
///     }
///
/// ### Styling Network Images
///
/// You can customize the appearance of network images by creating styles that conform to the
/// `NetworkImageStyle` protocol. To set a specific style for all network images within a view, use
/// the `networkImageStyle(_:)` modifier. In the following example, a custom style adds a grayscale
/// effect to all the network image views within the enclosing `VStack`:
///
///     struct ContentView: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack {
///                 NetworkImage(url: URL(string: "https://picsum.photos/id/1025/300/200"))
///                 NetworkImage(url: URL(string: "https://picsum.photos/id/237/300/200"))
///             }
///             .networkImageStyle(GrayscaleNetworkImageStyle())
///         }
///     }
///
///     struct GrayscaleNetworkImageStyle: NetworkImageStyle {
///         func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
///             configuration.image
///                 .resizable()
///                 .grayscale(0.99)
///         }
///     }
